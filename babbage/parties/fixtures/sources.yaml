I felt it so, the first time I saw the miracle, as it appeared to me; but I thought so much more, a year or two after, when a lady, to whom he had sacrificed some very precious time, on the supposition that she understood as much as she assumed to do, finished by saying “Now, Mr. Babbage, there is only one thing more that I want to know. If you put the question in wrong, will the answer come out right?” All time and attention devoted to lady examiners of his machine, from that time forward, I regarded as sacrifices of genuine good nature.”"

    quote: "“We both went to see the thinking machine (for such it seems) last Monday. It raised several Nos. to the 2nd & 3rd powers, and extracted the root of a Quadratic Equation. - I had but faint glimpses of the principles by which it worked -Babbage said it had given him notions with respect to general laws which were never before presented to his mind-For instance, the machine would go on counting regularly, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c-to 10,000-and then pursue its calculation according to a new ratio, which was, I think, 10,002, 10,005, 1O,009-but I am only certain that the numbers were no longer successive ones, and that their differences were neither in arithmetical nor Geometrical ratio, as far as I could apprehend. -If this occult principle of change existed in the law according to which the machine was constructed, (for Babbage discovered it to be latent in the mathematical formula originally applied by him) it may be consistent with the general laws of our solar system that the sun shall not rise tomorrow. -He said, indeed, that the exceptions which took place in the operation of his Machine, & which were not to be accounted for by any errors or derangement of structure, would follow a greater number of uniform experiences than the world has known of days & nights. -There was a sublimity in the views thus opened of the ultimate results of intellectual power.”"

In Passages he described one of the dolls, “whose eyes were filled with imagination . . . ”; however, from Ada’s letters to Mrs Somerville, it appears that she was more captivated by the Difference Engine than by the “Silver Lady.”"

They vary because Nature has put it out of their power to conform in all things to a given standard, but they vary as little as they can. This, in general society, produces a certain amount of insipidity, a want of heartiness, or earnestness, of any sort of warmth or glow. At [Babbage’s] saturday evening parties, where so many political, literary, scientific & artistic characters assemble, I should say that the distinguishing mark was want of all character for good or evil. . . . [I]t seems a pity that Babbage, Hallam, Whewell, Wilkie &c &c should move about requiring . . . to have labels pinned to their backs, in order to tell one from another.”"
