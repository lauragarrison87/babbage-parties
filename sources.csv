Martineau1855,(Martineau 1855),"“All were eager to go to his glorious soirées; and I always thought he appeared to great advantage as a host. His patience in explaining his machine in those days was really exemplary. I felt it so, the first time I saw the miracle, as it appeared to me; but I thought so much more, a year or two after, when a lady, to whom he had sacrificed some very precious time, on the supposition that she understood as much as she assumed to do, finished by saying “Now, Mr. Babbage, there is only one thing more that I want to know. If you put the question in wrong, will the answer come out right?” All time and attention devoted to lady examiners of his machine, from that time forward, I regarded as sacrifices of genuine good nature.”",166
Toole1992b,Toole (?),"“As Mrs. De Morgan wrote, ‘While other visitors gazed at the working of this beautiful instrument with the sort of expression, and I dare say the sort of feeling, that some savages are said to have shown on first seeing a looking glass or hearing a gun, . . . Miss Byron, young as she was, understood its workings, and saw the great beauty of the invention’ (Angluin, 7) ",434
deMorgan1882,(de Morgan 1882),"“My husband afterwards gave her daughter, Lady Lovelace, then Lady King, much help in her mathematical studies, which were carried farther than her mother’s had been. I well remember accompanying her to see Mr. Babbage’s wonderful analytical engine. While other visitors gazed at the working of this beautiful instrument with the sort of expression, and I dare say the sort of feeling, that some savages are said to have shown on first seeing a looking-glass or a hearing a gun – if, indeed, they had as strong an idea of its marvellousness – Miss Byron, young as she was, understood its working, and saw the great beauty of the invention.”",89
Darwin1839a,(Darwin 1839a),"“I am very much obliged to you for your several cards which you have so kindly sent us, & which I should have had greater pleasure in accepting than any other parties, had not I found by dear-bought experience that my health will not at present stand going out in the evening. I am going to take a liberty, which I trust you will excuse; it is to ask permission for my sister who is staying with us to accompany my brother, whom I understand you have also kindly asked, to your party tomorrow evening: Mrs. Darwin not being well enough to go out at present.”",

Stein1985,"Stein (1985) LP 886, Lady Byron to Dr. King, 21 June 1833.","“We both went to see the thinking machine (for such it seems) last Monday. It raised several Nos. to the 2nd & 3rd powers, and extracted the root of a Quadratic Equation. - I had but faint glimpses of the principles by which it worked -Babbage said it had given him notions with respect to general laws which were never before presented to his mind-For instance, the machine would go on counting regularly, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c-to 10,000-and then pursue its calculation according to a new ratio, which was, I think, 10,002, 10,005, 1O,009-but I am only certain that the numbers were no longer successive ones, and that their differences were neither in arithmetical nor Geometrical ratio, as far as I could apprehend. -If this occult principle of change existed in the law according to which the machine was constructed, (for Babbage discovered it to be latent in the mathematical formula originally applied by him) it may be consistent with the general laws of our solar system that the sun shall not rise tomorrow. -He said, indeed, that the exceptions which took place in the operation of his Machine, & which were not to be accounted for by any errors or derangement of structure, would follow a greater number of uniform experiences than the world has known of days & nights. -There was a sublimity in the views thus opened of the ultimate results of intellectual power.”",42
Toole1992c,(Toole 1992),"“Babbage invited Ada to see the miraculous Difference Engine a few weeks after they met. Ada’s impression of the Difference Engine was recalled by Sophia Frend more than fifty years later: “Miss Byron, young as she was, understood its working, and saw the great beauty of the invention.” An excerpt from Lady Byron’s letter to Dr King on 21 June  gives us more information about the first time she went with Ada to see the Difference Engine.”",

Toole1992d,(Toole 1992),"“By June 1834 Lady Byron wrote that Ada regarded “the Difference Engine as a friend.” Ada continued to attend Babbage’s Saturday night soirées. He sent her an invitation enticing her to come to see the “Silver Lady,” one of the two automatic dolls he had. In Passages he described one of the dolls, “whose eyes were filled with imagination . . . ”; however, from Ada’s letters to Mrs Somerville, it appears that she was more captivated by the Difference Engine than by the “Silver Lady.”",Kindle loc. 726

Ticknor1880,Ticknor (1880),"“About eleven o’clock we got away from Lord Fitzwilliam’s and went to Mr Babbage’s. It was very crowded tonight, and very brilliant; for among the people there were Hallam, Milman and his pretty wife; the Bishop of Norwich, Stanley, the Bishop of Hereford, Musgrave, both the Hellenists; Rogers, Sir J. Herschel and his beautiful wife, Sedgwick, Mrs Somerville and her daughters, Senior, the Taylors, Sir F. Chantrey, Jane Porter, Lady Morgan, and I know not how many others. We seemed really to know as many people as we should in a party at home, which is a rare thing in a strange capital, and rarest of all in this vast overgrown London. Notwithstanding, therefore, our fatiguing day, we enjoyed it very much.”",178
Coolidge2013a,Coolidge,"“Here was a gathering of the elect, a ‘re-union’ of literary & scientific men, artists, authors, celebrities of both sexes. Those who like myself had no claim of learning or letters for admittance into so choice an assembly, could only rejoice in the opportunity of seeing so many Lions in one cage. We had, Mr Babbage himself the inventor of the famous calculating machine. . .”",
Coolidge2013b,oolidge,"“The persons . . . whom I meet in society have all, more or less, the same style of manners and of dress, and their ordinary conversation is pitched nearly in the same key. They vary because Nature has put it out of their power to conform in all things to a given standard, but they vary as little as they can. This, in general society, produces a certain amount of insipidity, a want of heartiness, or earnestness, of any sort of warmth or glow. At [Babbage’s] saturday evening parties, where so many political, literary, scientific & artistic characters assemble, I should say that the distinguishing mark was want of all character for good or evil. . . . [I]t seems a pity that Babbage, Hallam, Whewell, Wilkie &c &c should move about requiring . . . to have labels pinned to their backs, in order to tell one from another.”",
Macready1875a,Macready (1875),"“Went to Babbage’s conversazione, where I saw Faraday, Wilkie, Chantrey, Hawes, who told me that the House gave me a lusty cheer on the occasion of Lord John Russell’s mention of my name. Babbage showed me a very curious machine to mark on paper the velocity of a steam-carriage, &c., its shakings both vertical and horizontal: also an effect of the sun’s rays on glass laid over a certain composition, which gives shade all round the object placed between the glass and composition. Sidney Smith, Lord Northampton, Mrs. Marcet, I also Saw.”",140
