"""
Script to clean up data about guests who attended Babbage's soir√©es in the 1830s and 1840s.
Data was first converted from a word doc to the parties_orig.csv file.

This script creates a new dataframe called parties and exports it to csv and excel formats. The 
dataframe contains the following fields (columns):

- date: date - sometimes exact, sometimes just year or year-month. Needs formatting somehow.
- guest: Name of the guest. 
            question: Names of the aristocracy are complex - for instance, should
            Annabella Byron be listed as Lady Byron? Might need to ask a historian. Could go with 
            whatever name their Wikidata entry has as the main form.
- qid: Wikidata identifier for the guest
- sourceID: unique identifier for the source, matches sourceID in sources.csv
- certainty_P1480: either 'presumably' or 'stated in source'. This measures how certain we are that 
this guest attended this party. In most cases 
the source is clear, but sometimes a guest is referenced just by their family name and there are multiple
people it could refer to. P1480 is a reference to the Wikidata property P1480, and 'presumably' is one of the 
options for this property.
- sourceID: a unique identifier for the source, usually the author's family name and year of publication
- quote: the direct quote that describes the guests and the party
- pages: page numbers in the bibliographic reference - will likely be combined with 
      bibliographic info later
