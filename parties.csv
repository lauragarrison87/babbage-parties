1839-02-16,Ellen Randolph Coolidge,Q60536153,,Coolidge2013a ; Coolidge2013b,244-246 ; 250-251,"""Saturday morning we breakfasted with M‘ Rogers and Saturday evening at half past nine, went to M‘ Babbage’s house in Dorset St. Manchester Sq. Here was a gathering of the elect, a “re-union” of literary & scientific men, artists, authors, celebrities of both sexes. Those who like myself had no claim of learning or letters for admittance into so choice an assembly, could only rejoice in the opportunity of seeing so many Lions in one cage. We had, Mr Babbage himself the inventor of the famous calculating machine, Mr Hallam, the author of the “Middle Ages,” the Revd Mr Whewell, whose Bridgewater Treatise I had read in the U.S. and whose Architectural Notes on German Churches I have been studying this summer, a propos to my recent acquaintance with English Cathedrals; Mr Morier, whose Hadji Baba in Persia & England, I have cried & laughed over; Judge Haliburton, alias Sam Slick; Mr Rogers, the poet of Memory & of Italy; Mr Hume, the political calculator; Mr Grote, the friend of the Ballot & of Dugald Stewart; Mr Taylor, the author of Philip Van Artevelde; Mr Justice Maule, who possessed of talents, knowledge, every thing which fits him to do honour to the place he holds, might have remained a simple barrister for all his life, had he not bought himself into Parliament — he gave two thousand pounds for a seat in the House of Commons, and a seat upon the Bench soon paid him his money with interest. This is the way they manage things in England it appears. Then came Sir Francis Chauntrey; Sir David Wilkie; Turner, a very favorite painter here though rather slightingly mentioned by Dr Waagen, who allows him great talent it is true, but reproves him for the abuse of it; Sir Charles & Lady Morgan; Mrs Austen, whose translation of the Letters of a German Prince (PucklerMuskau) the best translation ever made into the English language, has put her on a footing with original writers; Miss Martineau, to whom there is no denying the praise of talent, though accompanied by self-conceit & prejudice—such was the character of the company. There were a few titled persons present, among whom I heard the name of Lady Anna Maria Donkin, sister of the Earl of Minto, and the Earl of Selkirk, whose family history connects him with the more famous Paul Jones, who was the son of a gardener in the service of Lord Selkirk’s father. The Americans of the party were Mr & Mrs Stevenson, Mr John Van Buren, Mr Charles Sumner, Mr C. & myself. It was a pleasure to me to see so many persons whose names | had seen in print, and the assembly of the evening was literally what Carlyle calls “that crowning phenomenon, and summary of modern civilisation, a soirée of Lions.”’ There were no doubt “many blue men and women, dear Mrs Rigmaroles, great Mr Rigmaroles” in this company of distinguished persons— many “pewter tankards scoured bright” and mistaken by “dim-eyed animals” like myself, for “solar luminaries,” but there were also some rightful objects of that hero worship which even Carlyle applauds. “Veneration of great men is perennial in the nature of man; this in all times, especially in these, is one of the blessedest facts predicable of him.” The rooms, after a while, became crowded and warm, and I went below with Mrs Stevenson to get a cup of tea. Refreshments of various kinds were served up on tables behind which servants were stationed to attend upon the guests; there was tea, coffee, lemonade, wine, fruit, cake, thin bread & butter, and I believe sandwiches. Enough of every thing and good, but no affectation of style or shew. Returning up stairs I encountered Miss Rogers whom I like better & better. She is not only a sensible but a good-natured person. Now good nature is not a common virtue among the English. If they happen to possess they are ashamed to acknowledge it, and when you do find it, it has the charm of rarity. I was presented to some few persons, exchanged a few words with Mr & Mrs Hallam, Mr Whewell & Judge Haliburton, & held something approaching to a conversation with Mr Morier & Mr Babbage—but as to becoming acquainted with any one in such a crowd, and where all talk is necessarily desultory, I do not understand the possibility of it. Miss Martineau whom I knew in America, says, I am told, that she should be pleased to renew the acquaintance. If so let her make the first advance. She is on her own ground now and I am the stranger. I certainly shall not do homage to her. Lady Morgan was rather cold. One of my friends told me that I had committed an unpardonable mistake in speaking to her of any thing but herself & her own writings. That Glorvina expected to hear of nothing but her own perfections, and that when I talked to her on other subjects I had shewn a want of taste & feeling, at which she was naturally disgusted. Alas! —The little Goody was dressed in scarlet velvet with a black hat & feathers and a band of small diamonds over her brow, but the Irish witch prevails over all her finery. Mr Babbage invited us to join his saturday evening parties whenever we were not otherwise engaged—a permission of which we shall gladly avail ourselves."" ; “The persons, on the other hand, whom I meet in society have all, more or less, the same style of manners and “of dress, and their ordinary conversation is pitched nearly in the same key.

This is the way they manage things in England it appears. Then came Sir Francis Chauntrey; Sir David Wilkie; Turner, a very favorite painter here though rather slightingly mentioned by Dr Waagen, who allows him great talent it is true, but reproves him for the abuse of it; Sir Charles & Lady Morgan; Mrs Austen, whose translation of the Letters of a German Prince (PucklerMuskau) the best translation ever made into the English language, has put her on a footing with original writers; Miss Martineau, to whom there is no denying the praise of talent, though accompanied by self-conceit & prejudice—such was the character of the company. There were a few titled persons present, among whom I heard the name of Lady Anna Maria Donkin, sister of the Earl of Minto, and the Earl of Selkirk, whose family history connects him with the more famous Paul Jones, who was the son of a gardener in the service of Lord Selkirk’s father. The Americans of the party were Mr & Mrs Stevenson, Mr John Van Buren, Mr Charles Sumner, Mr C. & myself. It was a pleasure to me to see so many persons whose names | had seen in print, and the assembly of the evening was literally what Carlyle calls “that crowning phenomenon, and summary of modern civilisation, a soirée of Lions.”’ There were no doubt “many blue men and women, dear Mrs Rigmaroles, great Mr Rigmaroles” in this company of distinguished persons— many “pewter tankards scoured bright” and mistaken by “dim-eyed animals” like myself, for “solar luminaries,” but there were also some rightful objects of that hero worship which even Carlyle applauds. “Veneration of great men is perennial in the nature of man; this in all times, especially in these, is one of the blessedest facts predicable of him.” The rooms, after a while, became crowded and warm, and I went below with Mrs Stevenson to get a cup of tea. Refreshments of various kinds were served up on tables behind which servants were stationed to attend upon the guests; there was tea, coffee, lemonade, wine, fruit, cake, thin bread & butter, and I believe sandwiches. Enough of every thing and good, but no affectation of style or shew. Returning up stairs I encountered Miss Rogers whom I like better & better. She is not only a sensible but a good-natured person.

We had, Mr Babbage himself the inventor of the famous calculating machine, Mr Hallam, the author of the “Middle Ages,” the Revd Mr Whewell, whose Bridgewater Treatise I had read in the U.S. and whose Architectural Notes on German Churches I have been studying this summer, a propos to my recent acquaintance with English Cathedrals; Mr Morier, whose Hadji Baba in Persia & England, I have cried & laughed over; Judge Haliburton, alias Sam Slick; Mr Rogers, the poet of Memory & of Italy; Mr Hume, the political calculator; Mr Grote, the friend of the Ballot & of Dugald Stewart; Mr Taylor, the author of Philip Van Artevelde; Mr Justice Maule, who possessed of talents, knowledge, every thing which fits him to do honour to the place he holds, might have remained a simple barrister for all his life, had he not bought himself into Parliament — he gave two thousand pounds for a seat in the House of Commons, and a seat upon the Bench soon paid him his money with interest. This is the way they manage things in England it appears. Then came Sir Francis Chauntrey; Sir David Wilkie; Turner, a very favorite painter here though rather slightingly mentioned by Dr Waagen, who allows him great talent it is true, but reproves him for the abuse of it; Sir Charles & Lady Morgan; Mrs Austen, whose translation of the Letters of a German Prince (PucklerMuskau) the best translation ever made into the English language, has put her on a footing with original writers; Miss Martineau, to whom there is no denying the praise of talent, though accompanied by self-conceit & prejudice—such was the character of the company. There were a few titled persons present, among whom I heard the name of Lady Anna Maria Donkin, sister of the Earl of Minto, and the Earl of Selkirk, whose family history connects him with the more famous Paul Jones, who was the son of a gardener in the service of Lord Selkirk’s father. The Americans of the party were Mr & Mrs Stevenson, Mr John Van Buren, Mr Charles Sumner, Mr C. & myself. It was a pleasure to me to see so many persons whose names | had seen in print, and the assembly of the evening was literally what Carlyle calls “that crowning phenomenon, and summary of modern civilisation, a soirée of Lions.”’ There were no doubt “many blue men and women, dear Mrs Rigmaroles, great Mr Rigmaroles” in this company of distinguished persons— many “pewter tankards scoured bright” and mistaken by “dim-eyed animals” like myself, for “solar luminaries,” but there were also some rightful objects of that hero worship which even Carlyle applauds. “Veneration of great men is perennial in the nature of man; this in all times, especially in these, is one of the blessedest facts predicable of him.” The rooms, after a while, became crowded and warm, and I went below with Mrs Stevenson to get a cup of tea. Refreshments of various kinds were served up on tables behind which servants were stationed to attend upon the guests; there was tea, coffee, lemonade, wine, fruit, cake, thin bread & butter, and I believe sandwiches. Enough of every thing and good, but no affectation of style or shew. Returning up stairs I encountered Miss Rogers whom I like better & better. She is not only a sensible but a good-natured person. Now good nature is not a common virtue among the English. If they happen to possess they are ashamed to acknowledge it, and when you do find it, it has the charm of rarity. I was presented to some few persons, exchanged a few words with Mr & Mrs Hallam, Mr Whewell & Judge Haliburton, & held something approaching to a conversation with Mr Morier & Mr Babbage—but as to becoming acquainted with any one in such a crowd, and where all talk is necessarily desultory, I do not understand the possibility of it. Miss Martineau whom I knew in America, says, I am told, that she should be pleased to renew the acquaintance. If so let her make the first advance. She is on her own ground now and I am the stranger. I certainly shall not do homage to her. Lady Morgan was rather cold. One of my friends told me that I had committed an unpardonable mistake in speaking to her of any thing but herself & her own writings. That Glorvina expected to hear of nothing but her own perfections, and that when I talked to her on other subjects I had shewn a want of taste & feeling, at which she was naturally disgusted. Alas! —The little Goody was dressed in scarlet velvet with a black hat & feathers and a band of small diamonds over her brow, but the Irish witch prevails over all her finery. Mr Babbage invited us to join his saturday evening parties whenever we were not otherwise engaged—a permission of which we shall gladly avail ourselves."" ; “The persons, on the other hand, whom I meet in society have all, more or less, the same style of manners and “of dress, and their ordinary conversation is pitched nearly in the same key. They vary because Nature has put it out of their power to conform in all things to a given standard, but they vary as little as they can. This, in general society, produces a certain amount of insipidity, a want of heartiness, or earnestness, of any sort of warmth or glow. At “Babbage’s Menagerie,” as Lady Anna Maria Donkin calls his saturday evening parties, where so many political, literary, scientific & artistic characters assemble, I should say that the distinguishing mark was want of all character for good or evil. This is, I suppose, unavoidable, at least to a certain extent. If each individual carried into the company of others too much of his individual self there might be many petty shocks & some rude collisions. Yet it seems a pity that Babbage, Hallam, Whewell, Wilkie &c &c should move about requiring, as M' Morier said, to have labels pinned to their backs, in order to tell one from another. Yet it is better to have them simply ticketed with their names than be obliged to add as M’ William Coke did when he rode a vicious mare, “she kicks,” which might be the case were these gentlemen to come into society without leaving their individualities behind.""",,

Refreshments of various kinds were served up on tables behind which servants were stationed to attend upon the guests; there was tea, coffee, lemonade, wine, fruit, cake, thin bread & butter, and I believe sandwiches. Enough of every thing and good, but no affectation of style or shew. Returning up stairs I encountered Miss Rogers whom I like better & better. She is not only a sensible but a good-natured person. Now good nature is not a common virtue among the English. If they happen to possess they are ashamed to acknowledge it, and when you do find it, it has the charm of rarity. I was presented to some few persons, exchanged a few words with Mr & Mrs Hallam, Mr Whewell & Judge Haliburton, & held something approaching to a conversation with Mr Morier & Mr Babbage—but as to becoming acquainted with any one in such a crowd, and where all talk is necessarily desultory, I do not understand the possibility of it. Miss Martineau whom I knew in America, says, I am told, that she should be pleased to renew the acquaintance. If so let her make the first advance. She is on her own ground now and I am the stranger.

One of my friends told me that I had committed an unpardonable mistake in speaking to her of any thing but herself & her own writings. That Glorvina expected to hear of nothing but her own perfections, and that when I talked to her on other subjects I had shewn a want of taste & feeling, at which she was naturally disgusted. Alas! —The little Goody was dressed in scarlet velvet with a black hat & feathers and a band of small diamonds over her brow, but the Irish witch prevails over all her finery. Mr Babbage invited us to join his saturday evening parties whenever we were not otherwise engaged—a permission of which we shall gladly avail ourselves."" ; “The persons, on the other hand, whom I meet in society have all, more or less, the same style of manners and “of dress, and their ordinary conversation is pitched nearly in the same key. They vary because Nature has put it out of their power to conform in all things to a given standard, but they vary as little as they can. This, in general society, produces a certain amount of insipidity, a want of heartiness, or earnestness, of any sort of warmth or glow. At “Babbage’s Menagerie,” as Lady Anna Maria Donkin calls his saturday evening parties, where so many political, literary, scientific & artistic characters assemble, I should say that the distinguishing mark was want of all character for good or evil. This is, I suppose, unavoidable, at least to a certain extent. If each individual carried into the company of others too much of his individual self there might be many petty shocks & some rude collisions. Yet it seems a pity that Babbage, Hallam, Whewell, Wilkie &c &c should move about requiring, as M' Morier said, to have labels pinned to their backs, in order to tell one from another. Yet it is better to have them simply ticketed with their names than be obliged to add as M’ William Coke did when he rode a vicious mare, “she kicks,” which might be the case were these gentlemen to come into society without leaving their individualities behind.""",,

That Glorvina expected to hear of nothing but her own perfections, and that when I talked to her on other subjects I had shewn a want of taste & feeling, at which she was naturally disgusted. Alas! —The little Goody was dressed in scarlet velvet with a black hat & feathers and a band of small diamonds over her brow, but the Irish witch prevails over all her finery. Mr Babbage invited us to join his saturday evening parties whenever we were not otherwise engaged—a permission of which we shall gladly avail ourselves.""",,

By the way I heard a few days since, that this lady who spends much of her time at Geneva, had been remonstrated with by the Select-men or Syndics, (or by whatever name may be called the guardians of public morals in the City of Calvin,) on the bad example which she set in having, when she went out, a footman to walk after her, instead of a little maid with her clogs. Thus Luxury advances with rapid strides, the strides of a long-legged footman, over the territory of the Republic, and the wealth and pride of England are contaminating the purity of the ancient manners & modes of life in Geneva. This evening I made acquaintance with Sir David Wilkie & his sister. This lady sat for Meg in her brother’s picture of Duncan Gray. Meg is an improved likeness of Miss Wilkie, but still a likeness. Among the guests at M' Babbage’s were the President of the Royal Society the Marquis of Northampton, Sir Francis & Lady Chauntrey, Lady Ogle, sublime in velvet & point lace, & M. & Mme Van de Weyer—she in a white muslin dress & a coiffure of velvet & blonde, a solecism in dress of which no frenchwoman could ever have been guilty. The Grammar of the French toilette has it’s inviolable rules. Certain things go together, certain other things have no fitness of companionship. The subordinate parts of the dress must agree with the principals as the adjective agrees with it’s noun, or the verb with it’s nominative. Blond lace & velvet with Muslin is against the Syntax of dress, shews an ignorance of Concord & Government. The English commit many of these faults of Grammar. I have received a great deal of valuable instruction in this branch of female education from my french maid Josephine, who is learned and a pedant in such matters. The charm of a french toilette consists first in the observance of these laws, which have their foundation in good taste, but also in it’s fitness to time, place & season. The distinctions of summer, autumn, winter & spring dress, (I have seen an Englishwoman driving in Hyde Park in July with a Fur Boa on her shoulders,) of morning & evening, (English ladies sometimes wear rich silks to breakfast) of full dress and half dress, of walking, carriage & parlour costumes, are observed with a precision which custom renders easy. Then in a french toilette, even as I have seen it in England, there is a harmony of colours which you do not always find in the dress of an English lady, and there is a neatness & freshness in all the minor articles, gloves, shoes, ribbons, handkerchiefs, which I am sorry to say does not exist universally among similar small items, as they are worn & used by the Anglo Saxons. “They order these things better in France” than in any other part of the world.""","Sopwith, Thomas. 1891.

His patience in explaining his machine in those days was really exemplary. I felt it so, the first time I saw the miracle, as it appeared to me; but I thought so much more, a year or two after, when a lady, to whom he had sacrificed some very precious time, on the supposition that she understood as much as she assumed to do, finished by saying “Now, Mr. Babbage, there is only one thing more that I want to know. If you put the question in wrong, will the answer come out right?” All time and attention devoted to lady examiners of his machine, from that time forward, I regarded as sacrifices of genuine good nature.”","Martineau, Harriet. 1877.

I placed her under a glass case on a pedestal in my drawing-room, where she received, in her own silent but graceful manner, those valued friends who so frequently honoured me with their society on certain Saturday evenings. This piece of mechanism formed a striking contrast with the unfinished portion of the Difference Engine, No. 1, which was placed in the adjacent room: the whole of the latter mechanism existed in drawings upon paper before any portion of it was put together. […] The criticisms on the costume of the Silver Lady were various. In the course of the evening, Lady Morgan communicated to me confidentially her own opinion of the dress. Holding up her fan, she whispered, “My dear Mr. Babbage, I think your Silver Lady is rather slightly clad to-night; shall I lend her a petticoat?” to which I replied, “My dear Lady Morgan, I am much indebted for your very considerate offer, but I fear you have not got one to spare.””","Babbage, Charles. 1864.

Of course, I willingly gave the invitation, and then wrote a note to inform Lady M.......... of the occurrence of the opportunity she wished for. On the following Saturday evening Lady M.......... was announced, and immediately asked me whether Mr. Borrow had arrived. I said that he had, and that he was in the further room.

Lady M.........., who had several other engagements that evening, said, “Only tell me what sort of a person he is, and I will go and find him out myself.” I observed that he was a remarkably tall, straggling person, with a very intelligent countenance. With these instructions her ladyship left me, and finding, as she imagined, exactly the man I had described, immediately accosted him.
